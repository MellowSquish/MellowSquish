Hello, I’m Chloe Capriotti(She/Her).

I really enjoy the inner workings of computers and know a few different coding languages, including Swift, Python, Java, a little bit of C, HTML + more. 
I am a level 3 student at Algonquin College, Ottawa, taking Computer Engineering Technology: Computing Science, I enjoy meeting new people and collaborating on projects while everyone can input their own ideas into it.
I'm currently working on a few side projects with people and am extremely interested in hybrid projects where a program is built out of multiple coding languages.
Some of my other hobbies I've had include crochet, collecting(pokemon, funko pops), welding, guitar and many more!

You can reach me through my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-capriotti/ or email, @c.s.capriotti@gmail.com
