Hello, I’m Chloe Capriotti(She/Her).

I really enjoy the inner workings of computers and know a few different coding languages, including Swift, Python, Java, a little bit of C, HTML + more. 
I am a level 3 student at Algonquin College, Ottawa, taking Computer Engineering Technology: Computing Science, I enjoy meeting new people and collaborating on projects while everyone can input their own ideas into it.
I'm currently working on a few side projects with people and am extremely interested in hybrid projects where a program is built out of multiple coding languages.
Some of my other hobbies I've had include crochet, collecting(pokemon, funko pops), welding, guitar and many more!
